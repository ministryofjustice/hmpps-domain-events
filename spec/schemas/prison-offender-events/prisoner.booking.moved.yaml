summary: A NOMIS booking has moved between prisoners
description: |
  This is raised when a NOMIS booking is moved from one prisoner to a different prisoner. In NOMIS most details are
  held at booking level rather than prisoner level e.g. height, weight so it is important to listen to this event as
  well as to prison-offender-events.prisoner.merged
